### Sprite-based animation

AnimationExample sketch has an example of using my sprite code

Nick Fox-Gieg's slightly more complex/built-out example is here [N1ckFG/SpriteDemo](https://github.com/N1ckFG/SpriteDemo). I believe it includes loading sprite sheets, etc.

### State Machine/Mutli-sketch management

MultiSketch has an example of using subclasses of a Sketch class to manage different states of an app, i.e. multiple levels and start/end screens for a game. Based on code by Marius Watz.
